Hello friend reading this, 
This thesis (capstone) you are looking at was drafted as part of the Master's degree in Data Science and AI that I coursed and finished on 2024. 
Four people colaborated on this project. We worked on Google Colab and the datasets used were not provided. We enjoyed every step of it.


The thesis (capstone) project focused on addressing gender inequalities, a key objective in the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
A time-series prediction model was developed using the Prophet model to forecast gender equality trends across different countries up to the year 2030. 
This model utilised data from the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) and the Gender Equality Index (GEI), concentrating solely on GEI values per year and country, excluding domain values. 
The model provided predictions with confidence intervals, highlighting forecasted trends over time, such as for Spain.
This project aimed to answer critical questions regarding the distribution of gender equality indices across EU countries, identifying significant variables contributing to gender disparities, similarities between countries, and countries showing improvement towards the UN's gender equality goals.


If you would like to discuss and/or recreate this project, do not hesitate to contact me so I can send you the datasets files which are too heavy to upload here. 
Best, 
J.
